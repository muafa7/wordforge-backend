A worker process has 
failed to exit 
gracefully and has 
been force exited. 
This is likely 
caused by tests 
leaking due to 
improper teardown. 
Try running with 
--detectOpenHandles 
to find leaks. 
Active timers can 
also cause this, 
ensure that .unref() 
was called on them.

async operations 
that kept running 
after all tests 
finished?
